Messages are either implicit or explicit where an implicit message is one of:\n\n\n\n\na constructor (usually called \"create\");\n\n\na destructor (usually called \"destroy\");\n\n\n\"get_by_name_label\";\n\n\n\"get_by_uuid\"\n\n\n\"get_record\"; and\n\n\n\"get_all\".\n\n\n\n\nExplicit messages include all the rest, more class-specific messages (e.g. \"VM.start\", \"VM.clone\")\n\n\nEvery field has at least one accessor depending both on its type and whether it is read-only or read-write. Accessors for a field named \"X\" would be a proper subset of:\n\n\n\n\nset_X: change the value of field X (only if it is read-write);\n\n\nget_X: retrieve the value of field X;\n\n\nadd_to_X: add a key/value pair (only if field has type set or map); and\n\n\nremove_from_X: remove a key (only if a field has type set or map).\n\n\n\n\nClass: auth\n\n\nManagement of remote authentication services\n\n\nFields\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nMessages\n\n\nMessages\n\n\nstring set get_group_membership (string)\n\nThis calls queries the external directory service to obtain the transitively-closed set of groups that the the subject_identifier is member of.\n\nParameters: string subject_identifier   A string containing the subject_identifier, unique in the external directory service\n\nMinimum role:   read-only\n\nResult: set of subject_identifiers that provides the group membership of subject_identifier passed as argument, it contains, recursively, all groups a subject_identifier is member of.\n\nPublished in:   XenServer 5.5   \n\n\n\n\n\nstring get_subject_identifier (string)\n\nThis call queries the external directory service to obtain the subject_identifier as a string from the human-readable subject_name\n\nParameters: string subject_name The human-readable subject_name, such as a username or a groupname\n\nMinimum role:   read-only\n\nResult: the subject_identifier obtained from the external directory service\n\nPublished in:   XenServer 5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n(string \u2192 string) map get_subject_information_from_identifier (string)\n\nThis call queries the external directory service to obtain the user information (e.g. username, organization etc) from the specified subject_identifier\n\nParameters: string subject_identifier   A string containing the subject_identifier, unique in the external directory service\n\nMinimum role:   read-only\n\nResult: key-value pairs containing at least a key called subject_name\n\nPublished in:   XenServer 5.5   \n\n\n\n\n\nClass: blob\n\n\nA placeholder for a binary blob\n\n\nFields\n\n\ndatetime last_updated [read-only]\n\nTime at which the data in the blob was last updated\n\nPublished in:   XenServer 4.0   Time at which the data in the blob was last updated\n\n\n\n\n\nstring mime_type [read-only]\n\nThe mime type associated with this object.
